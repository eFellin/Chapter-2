Project Title: Outdoor worker knowledge on ticks and Lyme disease in Quebec

Project Description: A study was conducted whereby we considered worker demographics and personal experiences within one framework
to determine better the overall risk for those working in outdoor industries in Quebec. Analyzing outdoor worker demographics and
individual knowledge of ticks and Lyme disease can make a comparison between and within sectors. A questionnaire was given to 
voluntary participants asking for answers to demographic questions (age, sex, type of work) and individuals’ knowledge on ticks
and Lyme disease. This survey was accessible online or as a hard copy. Collaborators from the Centre d'Enseignement et de 
Recherche Forestiers (CERFO) and the Nature Conservancy will distribute these surveys to outdoor workers in industries they have
partnerships with. The survey was approved by the McGill University Ethics Committee for Health Research, REB File #: 22-03-058.
Behavioural risk scores were developed for individuals that participated in the survey, based on their answers to the tick and
Lyme disease knowledge questions in the questionnaire (Appendix 1). Scores were weighted based on their answers, with higher
scores indicating a greater risk of interacting with blacklegged ticks and potentially contracting Lyme disease.
